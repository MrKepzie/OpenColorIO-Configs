Generating Configurations
-------------------------

Configurations can be generated by the following *Python* package: https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.0/python

The resolution of 1D and 3D LUTs can be set by the user.

Usage is described in the package root [\_\_init__.py](https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/blob/master/aces_1.0.0/python/aces_ocio/__init__.py) file.

Two resolutions of configuration are available: 

- The current, default resolution is 33x33x33 for the 3D LUTs and 1024 for the 1D LUTs. They can be retrieved from the current repository:
	- https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.0/luts
	- https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/master/aces_1.0.0/baked

- A previous commit had resolutions of 65x65x65 for the 3D LUTs and 4096 for the 1D LUTs. They can be retrieved from the following commit:
	- https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/3df6975d47cdea87abdbbadf6640fc707f4728f0/aces_1.0.0/luts
	- https://github.com/hpd/OpenColorIO-Configs/tree/3df6975d47cdea87abdbbadf6640fc707f4728f0/aces_1.0.0/baked

The **ACES CTL** code used as source for the configuration is available here:
- https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/tree/v1.0
- https://github.com/ampas/aces-dev/releases/tag/v1.0

The current configuration depends on a **fork of the 1.0 ACES CTL** that is available here:
- https://github.com/hpd/aces-dev/tree/master/transforms/ctl
- The fork contains a few additional scripts in the utilities folder but is otherwise the same.
